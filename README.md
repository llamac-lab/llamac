# llamac

**llamac-lab** is a pure C runtime for LLaMA-based models â€” built for tiny devices, embedded environments, and maximum portability.

Think [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), but:
- Flattened into C
- Optimized for small memory
- Easy to integrate with any stack (Rust, Python, etc.)
- Born for the edge
